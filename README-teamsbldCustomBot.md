# Teamsbld Custom Bot - `teamsbldCustomBot`

## How to add the custom bot to a Teams team

To add the Teamsbld Custom Bot to a Microsoft Teams team, choose *View Team* and then choose the *Bots* tab. In the lower right corner click on *Create a custom bot*. Then fill in the name, the URL (https://tEamsbld.azurewebsites.net/api/custombot) and a description and click ok. Once the custom bot is registered you will recieve a _Security token_. Save this token in a secure place for future use, and you wil not be able to retrieve it again (NOTE: validation of this token is yet not implemented).

## Notes

You might recieve an error the first time you send a message to the bot, if you just deployed the solution. Custom bots must answer within 5 seconds.
